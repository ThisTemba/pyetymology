The term to link to (which this page is the present participle of).
This should include diacritics as appropriate to the language (e.g. accents in Russian to mark the stress, vowel diacritics in Arabic, macrons in Latin to indicate vowel length, etc.).
These diacritics will automatically be stripped out in a language-specific fashion in order to create the link to the page.
